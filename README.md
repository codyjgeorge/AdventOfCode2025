# AdventOfCode2025

This is my second time participating in AoC. Last December, I used Python. However, since starting school and beginning to learn C++, I decided to do this years AoC in C++ to further my skills in the language.

Feel free to leave comments/remarks if there is a faster more efficient way to solve the problems or if you see an opportunity to help me write cleaner code.

**Merry Christmas!**
